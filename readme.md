# Emiro - Search, find and execute shell snippets without leaving your terminal

Emiro was build for the problem that you need to leave your terminal for every snippet you want to insert in your terminal. With Emiro you can search for specific snippets and execute them. If you don't have the needed dependencies you can even run it everywhere(where you ran emiro remote service is running.

## Install 

Before emiro is not available in the package manager you have to download it here from the release page.

```wget
# Downlad emiro and put it in the bin directory

# give access rights to emiro
chmod +x /usr/bin/emiro 
```



## Roadmap

* [ ] Save the script local
  * It would be great to implement a save option to run snippets with specific parameter to keep dynamic 
* [ ] edit
  * It should be possible to edit the snippets from the terminal
* [ ] access rights
  * you can execute the snippets on a different server, so it would be important to limit the execution rights.
